# Amazing_Coders
Tufts Coding Academy 2024

## Our Project
Our project Amazing Racers is a similiar spin off of the popular arcade game Rally-x. We used pygame funtion in GitHub to make a GUI in order to project our code to the public. The main purpose of our game is to collect the flags in the quickest amout of time possible. The only rule of are game is to stay inside the bounderis becase if not your car will be slowed down icreasing the elapsed time.
